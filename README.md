# The Odin Project: Foundations

This repository contains my projects from The Odin Project's **Foundations** course. Each project is housed in its own folder, complete with detailed descriptions and supporting files.

## Repository Update 2025

I will no longer be using this repo to combine all the Odin projects into one repo. Will be leaving this repo here to preserve all the commit histories, however, will be creating a seperate repo for each new project going forward.

## Projects

### [Recipes Project](./recipes-project)

- A basic HTML-only project that serves as a recipe website with multiple pages.
- Focused on learning fundamental HTML structure and linking pages together.

### [Shinny Teeth Dental](./shiny-teeth-dental) - Landing Page Project

View live demo [here](https://odin.jasony.dev/shiny-teeth-dental/).

- A simple, responsive landing page created for a fictional company, **Shiny Teeth Dental**.
- Designed from scratch in Figma, then implemented using HTML and CSS.
- Features a mobile and tablet-friendly layout for better accessibility.

Feel free to explore each project by navigating to its folder. Each project showcases different aspects of web development, from basic HTML to responsive design with CSS. Happy coding!
